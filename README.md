Deloitte Australia - Data Analytics Job Simulation

# Task 1 - Data Analysis
## Project Overview
**"This project leverages Tableau for data analysis and visualization to track downtime across Daikibo’s four international manufacturing sites. By integrating telemetry data and creating insightful visualizations, this solution helps identify operational bottlenecks and informs maintenance strategies."**

## Feature / Project highlight
1. **Data Integration:** Integration of `JSON` telemetry data from Daikibo’s factories in `Tokyo`, `Osaka`, `Berlin`, and `Shenzhen`.
- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)
2. **Downtime Calculation:** Custom calculated field to track downtime, with 10 minutes per ‘`Unhealthy`’ machine status message.
3. **Data Visualization:** Built insightful **bar charts** to highlight.
- Downtime per Factory
- Downtime per Device Type
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** Dynamic dashboard with filtering capabilities for easy root cause analysis.
5. **Key Insight:** Identified factory with the highest downtime, revealing critical operational issues.
  
## Tools Used
- **Tableau:** Primary tool used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **JSON:** Data format used for importing telemetry data from the factories.
- **Tableau Desktop/Public:** Used for building visualizations and dashboards.

## Installation
1. **Install Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop**
2. **Download the free trial or public version from** : https://www.tableau.com/products/trial
3. **Data Import:** Import the provided `JSON` telemetry data files into Tableau to start visualizing the data.


# Task 2 - Forensic Technology
**Gender Pay Equality at Daikibo Industrials**
## Project Overview
To address gender pay inequality concerns at `Daikibo`, we developed an **Equality Score** ranging from `-100 to +100` to measure gender pay equality across the company.**

## Key Actions
A new column was added to the `dataset` to classify scores into 3 categories:
1. **Fair (±10):** Balanced pay
2. **Unfair (-10 < score < 10):** Some inequality
3. **Highly Discriminative (-20 < score < 20):** Significant inequality

## Tool Used
**Microsoft Excel:** 
- Used for `data handling`, `calculating the Equality Score`, and `classifying the data` using formulas.
- Excel also enabled efficient `data visualization` and `analysis with charts` and conditional formatting.
## Impact
- **Efficient Classification:** Quickly identified areas of concern.
- **Actionable Insights:** Highlighted roles and locations needing action.
- **Real-World Change:** Contributed to Daikibo’s efforts for fair compensation and equity.
